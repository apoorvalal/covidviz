# Exporatory Data Analysis and Visualisation of COVID19

Notebooks that download data and visualise the pandemic and policy responses in the US and around the world. I will not be writing a medium post with these.

+ US State level  cases, deaths and testing from the covidtracking project
+ US County level (particularly within CA) cases and counts from NYT
+ Cross-country cases, deaths, counts, and excess mortality from JHU and Our-world-in-data, and NYT
+ State level cases and counts from covidtracking india
+ Google Mobility reports visualisation for county level in US (again, bay area and LA area) and Adm1 subnationally in other countries
+ Policy stringency (Oxford Blavatnik Tracker)
